🛸 Project Lyra: Quantum Vortex Coherence AuditorThis repository contains the Data Visualization and Auditing Tools for the phase-coherence-based fluid dynamics solution. 

This experiment is documentary proof that turbulence can be organized through quantum phase fields, enabling the stability required to advance toward the Kardashev Scale.
"Reality is a constant state of interaction between that which observes and that which is realized." — Deywe Okabe⚖️ Ownership and RightsThis software, the calculation methodologies, and the associated datasets are the exclusive property of Harpia Quantum Brazil Israel.

Free Auditing: The use of this code is strictly authorized for auditing purposes and verification of the presented results.

Definitive Proof: The raw data and the emergent behavior in the visualizer are the only definitive proof required.🛠️ Available ToolsThis repository contains two distinct scripts for analysis:1. 

Integrity Auditor (dinamica_viewer_auditor_eng.py)

Technical script for cryptographic data validation. It traverses the dataset, verifies the SHA-256 hash of each frame, and calculates the physical stability metrics (Systemic Kinetic Energy, Phase Variance) that validate the SPHY--$\Phi$ Hamiltonian.

2. Dynamic Visualizer (dinamica_viewer.py)Graphical tool for topological inspection of the flow. It renders the velocity vector field and the density of the phase field $\Phi$ in real-time, allowing for the observation of the emergence of coherent vortex structures.

4. 📊 Auditing Datasets (Download Required)Due to data density and the SHA-256 integrity signature, the CSV files must be downloaded externally via Google Drive.Dataset Link:Google Drive Folder - Lyra DatasetsInstruction: After downloading, rename the desired file to auditoria_fluidos_lyra_signed.csv and place it in the same folder as the scripts.

6. ⚙️ ExecutionPrerequisitesPython 3.10+Libraries: pip install py5 pandas numpy tqdm1. For Technical AuditingBashpython3 dinamica_viewer_auditor_eng.py
2. For Graphical VisualizationBashpython3 dinamica_viewer.py
🧩 Integrity and SHA-256Each data point within the CSV is linked to a block integrity hash. Any manual alteration to the position vectors or the $\Phi$ (phase) values will result in a break in the data chain of custody, invalidating the audit.
